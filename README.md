# 2D Mini-Golf Game

Welcome to the 2D Golf Game project! This game allows you to play a simple golf game with a single hole. Below are the details on how to set up and play the game.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: Contains styles for the game, including layout, colors, fonts, and visual elements.
- `script.js`: Implements the game logic, including player interactions and game mechanics.
- `assets/images`: Directory containing visual assets such as backgrounds, golf balls, and holes.
- `assets/sounds`: Directory containing sound effect files used in the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the mouse to aim and click to hit the golf ball towards the hole.
3. Try to complete the hole in the fewest strokes possible!

## Setup Instructions

To run the game, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No additional setup is required.

If you change JavaScript or CSS files, update the `v=` query string on asset references (for example, `styles.css?v=20260208`) so browsers fetch the latest versions.
